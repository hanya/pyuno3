This is Python-UNO bridge forked from Apache OpenOffice rev 1367534. 
This can be build without hole source tree of the office.

Requirements
  - Apache OpenOffice 3.4? and its SDK.
  - Python 3.3 and its include files.
  Python 3.0 to 3.2 are not supported yet.

Build
  Setup SDK environment to build.
  > python setup.py build

  Only Linux platform is supported now. For other platform, setup.py 
  script should be updated according to SDK of the office.

  Resulting pyuno module is standalone which do not separeted in to 
  two libraries. And it can be used only as RPC client.

  You have to setup environmental variables before you to import the 
  module into your Python script.
  - URE_BOOTSTRAP
    specifies fundamentalrc, c.g.: 
    export URE_BOOTSTRAP=vnd.sun.star.pathname:/opt/openoffice.org3/program/fundamentalrc
  - LD_LIBRARY_PATH or PATH
    specifies basis3.X/program and ure/lib to be found required libraries.

Difference between Python 2 and Python 3 on PyUNO
  Most of differences are caused by Python itself.
  - String must be unicode known as normal str.
  - There is not int type anymore.
  - uno.ByteSequence must be initialized with bytes, bytearray or 
    ByteSequence instance.
  - No __members__ and __methods__ on pyuno instance.
